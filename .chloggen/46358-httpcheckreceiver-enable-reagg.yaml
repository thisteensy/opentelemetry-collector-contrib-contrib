subtext: |
  Attributes are classified as opt_in when aggregating across them produces meaningless results
  (error.message due to high cardinality), and recommended when totals remain operationally
  meaningful (http.url, http.method, http.status_class, http.status_code, network.transport,
  validation.type).
